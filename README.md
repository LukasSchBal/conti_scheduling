# conti_scheduling
Model is based on the paper of Ierapetritou and Floudas (1998): "Effective Continuous-Time Formulation for Short-Term  Scheduling. 1. Multipurpose Batch Processes" (Doi: 10.1021/ie970927g)  Paper is from paper series. Further constraints are explained in Part 2 and 3 but not implemented here: Part 2: includes continuous processes Part 3: includes intermediate due dates  Syntax is oriented towards Mendez (2006): "State-of-the-art review of optimization methods for short-term scheduling  of batch processes" (Doi: 10.1016/j.compchemeng.2006.02.008).   All parameters and variables are written as "name_index".
